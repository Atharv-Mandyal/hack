Background

The decline in student enrollment in government degree colleges is not a consequence of poor infrastructure or lack of teaching resources. At the heart of the problem lies a critical gap in awareness, most students and often their parents do not understand the importance of graduation, what career opportunities different degree courses unlock, or how to choose a subject stream based on personal interest and future prospects. After passing Class 10 or 12, students face confusion about:
• Which subject stream (Arts, Science, Commerce) to opt for.
• What kind of degree programs are available in nearby government colleges.
• What jobs or higher studies they can pursue after choosing a particular course.
• Whether pursuing graduation is even worth the effort, especially when short-term job or skill-based courses seem more accessible.

This lack of clarity leads to poor academic decisions, dropouts, or migration to private institutions that often promise but fail to deliver quality education.

Description

The above problem statement envisages that a customized Digital Guidance Platform for students should be developed as a one-stop personalized career and education advisor.

Key Features of the App/Web Platform:
• Aptitude & Interest-Based Course Suggestion: Short quizzes to assess the student's interests, strengths and personality traits. Based on results, the app will suggest suitable streams and subjects (Arts, Science, Commerce, Vocational). Students can compare career paths based on different combinations.
• Course-to-Career Path Mapping: Detailed visual charts showing what each degree (B.A., B.Sc., B.Com., BBA, etc.) offers. The industries or sectors each course leads to and relevant government exams, private jobs, entrepreneurial options, or higher education available after each stream.
• Nearby Government Colleges Directory: Location-based listing of government colleges, information on available degree programs; cut-offs and eligibility, medium of instruction, facilities (hostel, lab, library, internet access).
• Timeline Tracker: Notification system for admission dates, scholarship application windows, college entrance tests or counseling schedules.
• Customization and Personalization: User profiles created at login — tracking age, gender, class, academic interests. AI-driven recommendation engine suggests:
• Courses to apply for.
• Colleges nearby.
• Career paths aligned with their aptitude.
• Study materials tailored to subject choice.

Implementation Strategy
• Stakeholder Collaboration: Involve government education departments, school teachers, NGOs, and counselors for content and outreach.
• Technology Development: Partner with EdTech developers to build a scalable, lightweight app with offline features for poor internet areas.
• Pilot Launch: Start in one or two districts with low college enrollment. Get feedback from students and teachers.
• Full-Scale Rollout: Roll out state-wide or nationally through government schools and skill centers.
• Monitoring & Feedback: Real-time analytics to track usage, app suggestions, successful transitions to college enrollment.

Expected Solution

We propose the development of a mobile + web-based application that acts as a one-stop personalized career and education advisor. The platform will be designed for students guiding them in choosing the right subject combination after class 12th, selecting suitable degree courses in local government colleges, understanding the long-term outcomes of different courses (jobs, entrance exams, skill development) and accessing open-source e-books, skill materials, and scholarships.

Impact
• Improved enrollment in government degree colleges by helping students make informed academic decisions.
• Reduced dropouts after Class 10 and 12.
• Empowered students with access to reliable, localized career guidance.
• Stronger perception of government colleges as viable career-building institutions.
